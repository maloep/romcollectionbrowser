'88 Games (c) 1988 Konami.


Go for the gold in Konami's newest kit, '88 Games. Feel the thrill of competition as you test your Olympic skills against other world-class athletes. Bronze or silver medals are not good enough - you are going for the gold! However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event. Get pumped up to compete in the following events :

* 100m Dash : Race against the other athletes as well as the clock. This is just a warm-up compared to the events to come.

* Long Jump : Player dashes to the line, leaps, and propels his body as far as he is able. The player controls the speed and angle of the jump.

* 400m Relay (Qualifying Heat) : Speed and timing are crucial in this event. Player must coordinate the baton hand-off perfectly for the best qualifying time.

* Skeet Shooting : Player can aim left and right at the clay pigeons and must prove that he is a sure shot. A chance for bonus points is given for excellent marksmanship.

* 110m Hurdles : Player sprints down the track, timing his jumps perfectly to clear all of the hurdles and reach the finish line in time.

* Archery : This is a trial of the player's proficiency in using a bow and arrow. The player can decide the direction and force of the wind, which will help in demonstrating his skill as a sharpshooter.

* Javelin Throw : The player darts to the line and throws the javelin with all his might. The player controls the height of the javelin.

* High Jump : Another test of speed and strength as the player runs to the line and hurls his body over the bar. The player can control his angle above the bar.

* 400m Relay - The Final Race : The final test of physical training as the player faces the challenging relay again.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Final Fight : G.S.M. Capcom 3 - PCCB-00030) on 21/05/1990.


- UPDATES -


At the 5th position on the high score table, the Japanese version says 'j01' instead of 'o02'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint : Your airplane doesn't lose energy when it collides with cliff-walls, buildings etc. Instead it will rotate a bit after such collisions. That means you can tumble up and down these obstacles (keep on colliding), and if you keep shooting, your shots will go in all directions. This way you can clear up a lot of enemies when you are under pressure (while rolling you are invincible).

- SCORING -


Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.


The small red planes that fly formations of 5 or 10 are 100 points each.  Shooting all the planes in the 5 plane formation awards 500 bonus points.   Shooting all the planes in the 10 plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a powerup marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.


Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.


Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.


Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player�s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.


There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02 :

The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.

The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.

The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.

The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.


For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.


At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops :

100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded)

95-99% = 20,000 points

90-94% = 10,000 points

85-89% = 5,000 points

80-84% = 4,000 points

70-79% = 3,000 points

60-69% = 2,000 points

50-59% = 1,000 points

Under 50% = 0 points

Unused loops are 1,000 points each.


Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all 5 of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.


* On stages with the wingmang powerups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.


* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.


* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.


* An interesting bug : If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.


* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.


When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.


* There are 6 kinds of powerups : Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, 2 wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.


Quad fire powerups are found on stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.

Destroy all enemies powerups are found on stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.

Wingman powerups are found on stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.

Extra life powerups are found on stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.

Stop shooting powerups are found on stages 27 and 15.

Extra loop powerups are found on stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.


* % and point up stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.


* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that 10 ships or more are in the reserve, the 10 remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter sigma (&#931;).

SNK's second fighting-game franchise. It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former SNK illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" games.


This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.


The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.


The character's fighting stance and their victory pose depends on how beaten up they are.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play as Todoh, Jack, Lee, King, Micky and John : player 2 must join.


* Play as Mr. Big and Mr. Karate : reach them on 1P Game, then player 2 must join.


* Move Command Delay : its possible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as projectile attacks. Try it! :)

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1994.


This game is known in Japan as "Ryuuko no Ken 2".


Geese Howard's guest appearance (see 'Tips And Tricks' section) tries to tie this game's story with the Fatal Fury games. Apparently, this game takes place a few years before the events occurred in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" since Geese looks quite young and uses a very different fighting style (instead of his trademark Aikido which he learned in Japan). Another fact is the special ending when you defeat Geese (you get to see when he gives the order to eliminate Jeff Bogard who happens to be Terry & Andy Bogard's father, before he heads to Japan to learn that country's martial art techniques). This fact also explains why Ryo Sakazaki is so damn powerful in his "Fatal Fury Special" appearance (after all, he was already a powerful & skilled fighter and has had more time than most of the Fatal Fury characters to brush up on his techniques!). Obviously, all these storyline details were ignored in the King of Fighters series for the sake of convenience (All the "Art of Fighting" characters should be way older than the Fatal Fury characters in that game!).


In Temjin's ending, Terry Bogard makes a guest appearance as a little boy!


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version features different voice actors for some characters (John Crawley, Robert Garcia & King).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Adjust the game difficulty setting up to level 8 in order to boost game's overall speed!


It may be downright cheap & silly, but if you successfully manage to throw an opponent and then hit him with a special move as he gets up, you will dizzy your opponent! This can be done over and over again with most characters... :/


Beat opponents with a special move at the end of the decisive round to see a special 'defeat' animation (some auto-combos & special moves that lift the opponent of the ground won't work though).


Defeat all opponents in two rounds only to fight a special battle against Fatal Fury's main villain & owner of Southtown : Geese Howard (Notice that it is possible to use continues & use different characters as long as you defeat your opponents in 'two rounds only'!). :)
